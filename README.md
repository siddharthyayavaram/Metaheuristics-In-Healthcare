# Metaheuristics-In-Healthcare
## Metaheuristics for feature selection for medical applications

We briefly explain a high-level overview of the common structure and iterative nature of many
of the algorithms followed in the research papers we analyse.
The algorithms typically start by initializing a population of potential solutions. In each
iteration, a subset of solutions is selected based on their fitness, modified to explore and exploit
the solution space, and then evaluated for their fitness.
The best solutions are retained, and the process repeats until termination criteria are met. This
is analogous to the principle of “Survival of the Fittest” proposed by Charles Darwin. Only the
animals best suited to fully exploit the environment are allowed to survive.
These algorithms strike a balance between exploration and exploitation to efficiently search for
optimal or near-optimal solutions, drawing inspiration from animal behaviours like foraging,
flocking, or genetic evolution.
Although specific mechanisms may vary among algorithms, this iterative blueprint is a
fundamental characteristic they share.
Another topic very important in the field of artificial intelligence is how the ethical
considerations in feature selection are paramount in ensuring the responsible and fair use of
machine learning models. These considerations encompass the mitigation of bias and the
promotion of fairness in feature selection, transparency in the decision-making process, and
the protection of privacy and data security.
Ethical and explainable artificial intelligence is a field whose importance grows daily with the
advent of AI in our daily lives.
Moreover, ethical feature selection is an ongoing process that necessitates continuous
monitoring and adaptation to evolving ethical concerns and societal norms. Ultimately,
integrating these ethical principles into the feature selection process is fundamental to building
models that are both effective and morally sound.
